Scheduler speed test

This test is designed to measure the performance of I/O schedulers,
especially of BFQ, in the prospect of a possible integration in
blk-mq. The test exercises only blk, as existing I/O schedulers are
currently available only in blk. By comparing the performance of BFQ
with that of NOOP, it is possible to have an idea, by difference, of
the overhead entailed by BFQ.

The test is executed by a script, IO_sched-speedtest.sh, that measures
I/O speed for each scheduler and for each of the following I/O types:
- Sequential read
- Sequential write
- Random read
- Random write

The script generates, with fio, I/O for the null_blk virtual
device. The latter is configured to simply receive IOs as fast as
possible and acknowledge their completion immediately.  Further
details about the tests can be found in the script itself.

In more detail, here are the parameters used for null_blk:
- queue_mode=1
- irqmode=0
- completion_nsec=0
- nr_devices=1

Finally, we report below the output of the script for a system with
the SMP support disabled (to measure more precisely the overhead on a
CPU and rule out issues related to parallel execution). As for the
hardware configuration, the system was equipped with a 2.3 GHz CPU and
16 GB of DD3 RAM at 1600 MHz. The version of BFQ used in the test is
v7r11.
